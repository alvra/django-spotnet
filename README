# Django-Spotnet

This is a Django app to handle spotnet posts.
It can fetch posts from your NNTP server,
and push NZBs to your download server (eg: Sabnzbd+).


## Installation

Install with

    $ pip install hg+https://Blue@bitbucket.org/Blue/django-spotnet

You'll probably also want to install pytz and pycrypto
to get the correct timezones and verification of post signatures.

    $ pip install pytz pycrypto

Then update setting file:

    # settings.py

    INSTALLED_APPS += ('spotnet',)

    SPOTNET_SERVER_HOST = 'your.nntp-server.com'

with that last setting being the address
to a NNTP server, it's the only required setting. 
And set up the urls to the included views

    (r'^spotnet/', include('spotnet.urls')),

When you're ready, sync and update your database.

    $ python manage.py syncdb
    $ python manage.py update_spotnet

You're good to go!
